Alcohol free beer and wine has got much better in recent years, a personal favourite of mine is Lucky Saint beer.

(Disclaimer: Beer has never been a huge source of temptation for me. I was a wine and spirits drinker. The NA wine available in my area is so terrible that I gave up on it, and NA spirits are too expensive to justify. If I had *good* NA wine or spirits, that could have been a slippery slope.

Athletic makes the best in my opinion, highly recommend giving their subscription a go as it gives you access to the micro lot stuff you can\u2019t get at the store.
