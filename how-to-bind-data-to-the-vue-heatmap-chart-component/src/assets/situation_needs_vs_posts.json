I was a wine and spirits drinker. The NA wine available in my area is so terrible that I gave up on it, and NA spirits are too expensive to justify. If I had *good* NA wine or spirits, that could have been a slippery slope. NA beer isn't going to do that *for me*.)", ">So strange we have been conditioned to alcohol and it's effects being so normalized.
